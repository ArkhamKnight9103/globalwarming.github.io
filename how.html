                You may not know how, or you may not think your help is significant enough to really make a difference.

                There are many ways you can help that will actually make a difference
                and help the environment around you. In order to reduce gasses released into the air, you can carpool, 
                ride a bike, or ride the bus. This also reduces gas consumption and is generally cheaper.

            <ul class="list">
                <li>reduce the level of fossil fuel use in your daily life, this causes more greenhouse gases to get released into the atmosphere and therefore causing global warming</li>
                <li>plant trees, it released carbon dioxide which is the most important greenhouse gas and it can actually help stop global warming. </li>
                <li>conserve water, it supplies lots of the energy that goes to cities and that helps contribute to greenhouse gas emissions</li>
                <li>reduce the amount of waste, the production of garbage is a big contribution to global warming</li>
            </ul>
