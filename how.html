                You may not know how, or you may not think your help is significant enough to really make a difference. 
                <strong>It is not.</strong> There are many ways you can help that will actually make a difference
                and help the environment around you. In order to reduce gasses released into the air, you can carpool, 
                ride a bike, or ride the bus. This also reduces gas consumption and is generally cheaper.
